= Content Ingestion Spike =

This project is designed for technology spikes on tools, techniques and conventions for the new content ingestion system. The code will not be used in production but can serve as a template in addition to a proving ground for everything from the libraries used, to object naming conventions.

== Current Interesting Things in the Project ==

* CQRS
* Event Sourcing
* Naming conventions for command and event driven systems

== Getting Started ==
* Clone it
* Open the solution file
* Ctrl+F5 will run the console app which hosts the web pages
* Hit http://localhost:1212/ in a browser to check it's alive
* Choose an end point to send your first command

== But What Does It Do? ==
At the moment the end points should start the command/event chain and update the PersistentStore object with changes to the domain objects.

Next steps are to expose the state of the PersistentStore and EventStore repositories to the web pages so you can hit a command end point and see the consequences. The main point though, is the actual code and architecture.
